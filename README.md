# 100 Days Of Miva - Web Development Projects

![#100daysofMiva Banner](public/20240818_225416.png)

Welcome to my repository for the #100daysofMiva challenge! This repository contains a collection of simple projects developed over 100 days. The challenge is all about consistency, learning, and building resilience through daily coding.

## About the Challenge

The #100daysofMiva challenge is designed to help developers, especially students of Miva Open University, develop a strong work ethic by committing to coding every day. The goal is to spend at least one hour each day working on a small project, pushing the boundaries of our skills, and documenting our progress.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into three main sections, each corresponding to a different programming language:

**Note:** This is a means for me to learn new languages, while making sure I haven't lost touch with the languages I already know. My design skills are a work in progress, so please bear with me 😂😭✌🏻
